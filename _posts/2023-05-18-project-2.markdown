description: This project was the first major group project I have done in computer science. We were tasked to create a budget app using C# and WPF that built off code provided by the teacher. I completed this project with two of my classmates, and it was an enjoyable experience.
description-2: The app itself is a budget. Using a database, you can keep track of all your spendings and earnings by adding, modifying, and deleting expenses. Everything you have entered into the database is then displayed on the screen.
description-3: There are a lot of features and smaller details in the app, ranging from being able to remember previous databases that have been used to being able to add new categories of expenses. One of these features that I worked on and am quite proud of is the export functionality.
description-4: As you'll see below, when viewing all the expenses, there is an export button near the top right of the screen. When pressing this, it creates a csv file of all the expenses that are displayed, including any filters that are applied.

description-5: Part of why I enjoyed doing this as much as I did was because it made the project feel complete to me. Considering when the app was first started, we had to read and write to xml files to access the data, it felt like we had made it full circle to be able to allow the user a chance to get the data in a format other than in the database.
