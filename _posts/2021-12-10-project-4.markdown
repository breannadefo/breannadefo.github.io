description: This game is one of the first 'big' projects I ever made. It was for the final project of the first programming class I took in college.
description-2: The game I is a mashup of the mobile games 'Color Switch' and 'Flappy Bird'. Here is a screenshot of what the gameplay looks like.

description-3: While this might not be the most advanced or well programmed thing I've ever made, I wanted to put it here to show my progress. I have come a long way and have learned a lot since this game was created. When I opened it and saw that it was all in the console, I got flashbacks of back when I first started learning how to code. Honestly, playing it again a couple years later felt a bit nostalgic.
description-4: Either way, I remember being really proud of this game when I made it, so this is here to honor my younger self.
